/**
 * @file CheckAreaWrapper.js
 *
 * @synopsis
 * A wrapper component for the CheckArea that provides a simplified interface for demonstration,
 * testing, and documentation purposes in the checking-tool-rcl library.
 *
 * @description
 * The CheckAreaWrapper component creates a self-contained environment for displaying and interacting
 * with the CheckArea component, which is the core UI element for Bible translation checking.
 *
 * This wrapper:
 * - Initializes all necessary mock data and handlers for the CheckArea
 * - Provides a containerized view with appropriate styling
 * - Sets up a complete checking context with sample verse text, selections, and Bible data
 * - Allows the CheckArea to be demonstrated without the full Checker component infrastructure
 *
 * The component is primarily used in the component documentation (via Styleguidist) to showcase
 * the CheckArea functionality in an isolated environment.
 *
 * @requirements
 * - React 18.3.1+
 * - Access to CheckArea component from tc_ui_toolkit
 * - A translation function for UI strings

When we are in God’s presence we may feel that we do not belong to God because of our sins. When that happens, we can reassure ourselves that we truly do belong to him.
